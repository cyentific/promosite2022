    <div class="hide">Carlijn Jacobs is a photographer and director based in
  Paris. Born in the Netherlands, she studied photography at Willem de
  Kooning Academy in Rotterdam where she gained early recognition for her
  witty critiques of mass culture. She is associated with a new generation
  of artists who have matured amid easy access to unlimited reservoirs of
  historical and contemporaneous imagery. Jacobs has drawn inspiration from
  Surrealism, Art Deco and Camp, which she employs as a sly counter to
  modernism’s conservative definitions of art.<br><br>Although she
  methodically plans her projects, she creates environments with an eye
  toward achieving surprising and unconventional results. Jacobs’ first
  monograph, Mannequins, was published in 2021 by Art Paper Editions.
  Her editorial projects have appeared in Vogue Paris, Vogue Italia,
  AnOther Magazine and M le Monde. Her commercial clients include Chanel,
  Moncler, Berluti and Versace.<br></div>
